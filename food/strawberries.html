            <h1> Strawberrying</h1>
            <h3>by May Swenson</h3>
            <p> My hands are murder-red. Many a plump head<br>
                drops on the heap in the basket. Or, ripe<br>
                to bursting, they might be hearts, matching<br>
                the blackbird’s wing-fleck. Gripped to a reed<br>
                he shrieks his ko-ka-ree in the next field.<br>
                He’s left his peck in some juicy cheeks, when<br>
                at first  <a href="../food/shrimp.html">blush</a> and mostly white, they showed<br>
                streaks of  <a href="../food/chocolatemilk.html">sweetness</a> to the marauder.<br>
                <br>
                We’re picking near the shore, the morning<br>
                sunny, a slight wind moving rough-veined leaves<br>
                our hands rumple among. Fingers find by feel<br>
                the ready fruit in clusters. Here and there,<br>
                their squishy wounds . . . . Flesh was perfect<br>
                yesterday . . . . June was for gorging . . . .<br>
                sweet hearts young and firm before decay.<br>
                <br>
                “Take only the biggest, and not too ripe,”<br>
                a mother calls to her girl and boy, barefoot<br>
                in the furrows. “Don’t step on any. Don’t<br>
                change rows. Don’t eat too many.” Mesmerized<br>
                by the largesse, the children squat and pull<br>
                and pick handfuls of rich scarlets, half<br>
                for the baskets, half for avid mouths.<br>
                Soon, whole faces are stained.<br>
                <br>
                A crop this thick begs for plunder. Ripeness<br>
                wants to be ravished, as udders of cows when hard,<br>
                the blue-veined bags distended, ache to be stripped.<br>
                Hunkered in mud between the rows, sun burning<br>
                the backs of our necks, we grope for, and rip loose<br>
                soft nippled heads. If they bleed—too soft—<br>
                let them stay. Let them rot in the heat.<br>
                <br>
                When, hidden away in a damp hollow under moldy<br>
                leaves, I come upon a clump of heart-shapes<br>
                once red, now spiderspit-gray, intact but empty,<br>
                still attached to their dead stems—<br>
                families smothered as at Pompeii—I rise<br>
                and stretch. I eat one more big ripe lopped<br>
                head. Red-handed, I leave the field.
