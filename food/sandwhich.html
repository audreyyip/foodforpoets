            <h1> Strawberrying</h1>
            <h3>By May Swenson</h3>
            <p> <pre> My hands are murder-red. Many a plump head
                drops on the heap in the basket. Or, ripe
                to bursting, they might be hearts, matching
                the blackbird’s wing-fleck. Gripped to a reed
                he shrieks his ko-ka-ree in the next field.
                He’s left his peck in some juicy cheeks, when
                at first blush and mostly white, they showed
                streaks of sweetness to the marauder.
                
                We’re picking near the shore, the morning
                sunny, a slight wind moving rough-veined leaves
                our hands rumple among. Fingers find by feel
                the ready fruit in clusters. Here and there,
                their squishy wounds . . . . Flesh was perfect
                yesterday . . . . June was for gorging . . . .
                sweet hearts young and firm before decay.
                
                “Take only the biggest, and not too ripe,”
                a mother calls to her girl and boy, barefoot
                in the furrows. “Don’t step on any. Don’t
                change rows. Don’t eat too many.” Mesmerized
                by the largesse, the children squat and pull
                and pick handfuls of rich scarlets, half
                for the baskets, half for avid mouths.
                Soon, whole faces are stained.
                
                A crop this thick begs for plunder. Ripeness
                wants to be ravished, as udders of cows when hard,
                the blue-veined bags distended, ache to be stripped.
                Hunkered in mud between the rows, sun burning
                the backs of our necks, we grope for, and rip loose
                soft nippled heads. If they bleed—too soft—
                let them stay. Let them rot in the heat.
                
                When, hidden away in a damp hollow under moldy
                leaves, I come upon a clump of heart-shapes
                once red, now spiderspit-gray, intact but empty,
                still attached to their dead stems—
                families smothered as at Pompeii—I rise
                and stretch. I eat one more big ripe lopped
                head. Red-handed, I leave the field.
